# Report 1 Review
##### for Apurva Raman and Celina Bekins
##### by William Lu

1. What is the primary motivating question of this report?

   Do Europeans, by country, have a preference for Jewish, Muslim, or Gypsy immigrants? Is there an overall preference among Europeans for Jewish, Muslim, or Gypsy immigrants? This is clearly stated in the report.

2. What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

   This report uses data from the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 7 conducted in 2014 by ESS ERIC, which is a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) created by the EU to measure "attitudes, beliefs, and behaviour patterns of diverse populations." This is also clearly stated in the report.

3. What analyses did the author perform?

   Apurva and Celina plot cumulative distributions for immigration preferences among all respondents. They also break down "preference for immigrants" for Jewish, Muslim, and Gypsy immigrants by country and plot those as histograms.

4. Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

   The analysis does provide an answer: Jewish immigrants are most preferred by European countries, and the least preferred group is Gypsies. An interesting pattern that is noted: countries that have high mean values for one group of immigrants will typically also have high mean values for all immigrants (countries that are more accepting of any immigrant group are generally more accepting of immigrants).

5. Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

   The interpretation/analysis section is very clear as to the findings of the report, but the results could be interpreted more. I have no idea what a "high mean value" is for immigration preference, and I don't know how different values for immigration preference relate to each other. What does it mean to have a 1 for immigration preference versus a 0.5? This can be explained in the written portion of the report and more clearly marked in figures and figure captions.
   
   In terms of figure clarity, the graphs in the results section need to be interpreted more, as stated earlier. Figures 2 and 3 are particularly confusing, because even while each individual plot is meant to be a subplot of the figure, that is not apparent. The figure captions don't help explain this, either. A better way to compare preference amongst countries for Jewish, Muslim, and Gypsy immigrants would be to plot all three immigrant preferences on the same histogram. Each country will have three bars, one for Jewish, one for Muslim, and one for Gypsy immigrants. This will greatly simplify your figures and make it easier for readers to compare immigration preferences within the same country as well as between different countries. In addition, a small table or guide in the interpretation/analysis portion of the report that informed the reader as to which country is represented by which abbreviation would be nice. For example, it is not readily apparent to the reader that "CH" is Switzerland.

6. Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?

   Please check your report for typos -- there are definitely some things leftover from editing, like an "I don't think so?" at the end of the interpretation/analysis section.
