# Report 1 Review
##### for Sungwoo Park
##### by William Lu

1. What is the primary motivating question of this report?
  
   Is there seasonality in the number of likes for social media posts from news outlets? This is clearly stated in the report, but why did  you decide to look at seasonality for social media likes in the first place?

2. What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

   While the report states that it uses a "dataset containing over 4 million facebook posts from 15 mainstream news outlets," it does not identify the explicit source of the dataset. You should probably provide enough information about the dataset so that I could find it myself and take a look at the methodology or other information.

3. What analyses did the author perform?

   Sungwoo performs an autocorrelation function on residuals for his data in order to investigate the serial correlation values for various lag lengths.

4. Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

   Yes: there does not seem to be a serial correlation amongst the number of likes that media outlet social media posts get.

5. Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

   I think the report could be both more clear and more engaging. Explaining what seasonality is and why computing the serial correlation values on your time series data will help you identify seasonality would be nice for any reader that isn't taking (or has not taken) a statistics class. A visual representation of your time series data would also be a good addition to the article -- as of now, I'm looking at a table with a lot of serial correlation values. While the table is useful and I can see that the serial correlation values are all small, it might be helpful to plot some of the time series data to further back up your point. Most data that exhibits strong seasonality of some kind will show that seasonality when graphed as time series data.

6. Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?

   I don't see any obvious spelling, grammar, and formatting errors.
